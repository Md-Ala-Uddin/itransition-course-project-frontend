/**
 * ***Settings of the template are the following:***
1. title,
2. description (with markdown formatting support),
3. topic (one value from the predefined list, for example, "Education," "Quiz," and, of course, "Other"—new values to this list are added through the database; there is no need for the UI),
4. optional image/illustration (uploaded by the users into the cloud),
5. tags (the user can enter several tags; it’s necessary to support autocompletion—when the user starts text entering, you have to display a dropdown with tags starting with the entered letter already stored in the database).
